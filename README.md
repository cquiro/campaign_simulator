# campaign_simulator
This is a Ruby program that simulates a campaign. You can create politicians and voters, list them, update 
them one at a time and simulate the voting. The outcome depends on the politics of the voters, so if most of
them are liberal and socialist, then the elected official would most likely be democrat.
